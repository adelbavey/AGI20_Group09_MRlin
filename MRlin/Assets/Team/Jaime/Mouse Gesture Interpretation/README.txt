player script.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

Gesture Object
-------------

You must set the tag of the object that you want interact how "Interective".

From here you can do your own scripts, the script must have some functions to work though:

void setGestureConfig() - Here you set the gesture pattern for recognition, you can also set the sucess rate in here.

for setting the texture you have to use the method: setTextureG(Texture 2D)
Exemple: player.GetComponent<GesturePlayer.PlayerInput> ().setTextureG (text);

for setting the sucess rate use the following method: setCorrectRate(float 0f..1.0f)
Exemple: player.GetComponent<GesturePlayer.PlayerInput> ().setCorrectRate(0.7f);

To get when the player successfully made the gesture use the function: void onGestureCorrect()

If you want to know when the player failed in the gesture use the function: void onGestureWrong()

If you wanna do something when the player aproach and look the object with the gesture use: displayPattern()
this method is recommended if you wanna display the pattern for the gesture.

Clickable Object
----------------

If you wanna do an clickable object, our asset can help too.

Just set the tag for the object with "Clickable"
And use this function on script: onClick


Everthing write here is also commented in the code of the script from the exemple scene.
