A collection of files from the different projects. Not included are Michaelas and Jaime's, due to some implementation and merge issues that weren't a priority to fix. Since build time takes siginifacntly longer if added, Alex's terrain is not added to the scene.

ANS is the scene, containing a guy. For the purposes of the demo, it simply shoots at wherever the mouse clicks.

For the networking part, built one version for the pc and one for android. Host the server/client on Android, and create a host on the pc/laptop. Use the android ip address to connect. Click on the screen and on both screens will fire. Gyro not implemented due to not enough time to work out calibration difficulties.
