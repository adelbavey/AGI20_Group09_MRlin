Unity version 2020.1.6f1

Project for KTH course DH2413 Advanced Graphics and Interaction, Fall 2020 edition.

Spell casting game where a phone is used in place of a "wand". The phone's gyro is used to paint symbols in the air, which launches spells at the AI opponent/other player. Camera tracking is also used to track player horizontal movement to dodge spells.

"main" branch contains experimental online multiplayer game. Relevant scene is MRlin/Assets/Team/Adel/MainGame. Implemented using the open source Mirror Networking library for Unity ([link](https://mirror-networking.com/)). Playable version found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k-mavsMUS-anP8W5GcfNqFCGdj2-GbjC).

"Single_Player_Demo" branch contains a functioning single player version. Relevant scene is MRlin/Assets/Team/Yufei/Scenes/Single Player Mode. For the intended way to be played, must be run through Unity Editor with Unity Remote ([link](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.1/Documentation/Manual/UnityRemote5.html))
